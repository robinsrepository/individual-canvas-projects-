# Individual canvas projects 📁

These files include all the canvas projects I made while practicing JavaScript.
I just wanted to add the individual files in case anyone would like to see the notes I took during the tutorials.
To view them in the browser go to the README file in [this repo](https://github.com/robinsrepository/javascript-canvas).
